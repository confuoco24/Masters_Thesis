This folder contains the experiments performed in the development of my master's thesis "Evaluating the Role of Quantum Algorithms in Supervised Machine Learning":

- DLP_dataset_generation: Code used to generate the three DLP-distributed binary datasets.
- DLP_64: Code used to compare a Quantum Kernel SVM to its classical counterpart in a 64-bit DLP dataset.
- DLP_512: Code used to compare a Quantum Kernel SVM to its classical counterpart in a 512-bit DLP dataset.
- DLP_1024: Code used to compare a Quantum Kernel SVM to its classical counterpart in a 1024-bit DLP dataset.
