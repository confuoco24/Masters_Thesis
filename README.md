This folder contains the different programs utilized in the development of my master's thesis. It contains the following files:

- DLP_dataset_generation: Code utilized to generate the three different DLP distributed binary datasets utilized in the following experiments.
- DLP_64: Code utilized to compare a Quantum Kernel SVM to its classical counterpart in a 64-bit DLP dataset.
- DLP_512: Code utilized to compare a Quantum Kernel SVM to its classical counterpart in a 512-bit DLP dataset.
- DLP_1024: Code utilized to compare a Quantum Kernel SVM to its classical counterpart in a 1024-bit DLP dataset.
